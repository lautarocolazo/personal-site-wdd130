        We find ourselves in a moment where every day we are bombarded with news, and false information, where they compare us, where they do everything possible so that we buy and consume all kinds of content. This has caused a global mood imbalance, where we only feel stress, anxiety, and depression. But what if the solution was easier than we think? The ancient philosophers dedicated their lives to finding the best way to approach those problems. On this website, we teach you about Stoicism and how we can apply daily ancient philosophy in a simple way and change our vision of the world instead of changing the world so as not to be affected by negative events.

        What is Stoicism?

Ancient philosophy? Those old men with beards? That is so boring… Well, actually turns out that is not and it could be very beneficial for every person. Stoicism is a school of ancient philosophy founded by a person called Zeno of Citium in Athens a long time ago. It is a philosophy of personal virtue ethics. They believe that “one flourishes by living an ethical life”, which is basically to be a good person and to do good. 

Marcus Aurelius, a stoic, was the emperor of Rome between 161 and 180 A.D. and probably the most powerful and important person at that time. He was an emperor, a leader, a father of fourteen children, a husband, and many more matters to take care of, and even with that he encountered the time to write a personal journal, not intended to be shown to anyone, but today that is known as “Meditations by Marcus Aurelius” where we can learn about his efforts of doing good in this world through Stoicism. There we read his thoughts about waking up early in the morning to do good such as: 

“When you find an unwillingness to rise early in the morning, endeavor to rouse your faculties and act up to your kind, and consider that you have to do the business of a man; and that action is both beneficial and the end of your being”

or about being a good person like: “Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.”

or not being poisoned by revenge: “The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.”

or focusing on the things that are in our control to be happy: “You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”, which is an eternal principle that The President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Russell M, Nelson, taught when he said: “The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives.”

So, don't we already know that we have to be good people? Don’t we already know that serving other people is good and not doing so is bad? Probably yes, but they give us a deeper perspective and practical ways to apply it day by day. 

The result? Better people, better citizens, better parents, a better community, better leaders
